Both of these are computer languages that help in programming, but there is a 
major difference between JavaScript and HTML. While JavaScript (abbreviated as 
JS) is a scripting language, HTML is a markup language.

We use HTML to create web pages or web applications. We can also embed JS 
programs in the form of scripts in the HTML code. This converts the overall 
static form of the web content into a dynamic form, i.e., it modifies the 
content on the web pages without having to reload it. Thus, the content would 
keep changing in real-time, like in those cryptocurrency websites.

We use the JS to make pages more interactive for visitors, like in weather 
forecast websites or cryptocurrency update pages.
HTML is mainly used to define a web pageâ€™s basic structure and layout
