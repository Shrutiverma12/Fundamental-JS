Developers name everything from variables, functions, classes to files, however 
many times we focus on solving a problem and we do not worry about readability 
and best practices while naming. Variable naming is an important aspect in 
making your code readable so, you should follow a simple idea: Create variables 
that describe their function.There is a reason why we do not use memory 
addresses and have names instead: names are much easier to recall. And, more 
importantly, they can give you more information about the variable, so someone 
else can understand its significance.
Bad:
var d; // elapsed time in days
Good:
var elapsedTimeInDays;
var daysSinceCreation;
var daysSinceModification;
