JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more 
readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing 
alternative code.

Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.

Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
