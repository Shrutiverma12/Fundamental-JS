Unary Operators in JavaScript
Unary operators are the simplest of the three categories of JavaScript 
operators. They operate on a single operand, which is a variable or a value. You 
can use unary operators to increment or decrement a variable, change the sign of 
a number, or perform logical negation.
Example-
let x = 5;

x++; // Increment x by 1, now x is 6

x--; // Decrement x by 1, now x is 5 again

Binary Operators in JavaScript
Binary operators take two operands, which can be variables, values, or 
expressions, and they perform operations on them. You can use binary operators 
for arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations.
Example-
let sum = 3 + 4; // sum is 7
let product = 5 * 6; // product is 30
let isEqual = (x == y);
// isEqual is false (assuming x and y are different)

The Ternary Operator
There is a single ternary operator which you can use to produce more concise code
Example-
let age = 20;

let status = age >= 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";

// age is 20, so status will be "Adult";

// if age was 15, status would be "Minor"
